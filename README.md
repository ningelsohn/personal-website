# Personal Website: Jan Ningelgen

To highlight my skills with frontend development I have created this personal website.
It focuses not only on the implementation, but also the design of innovative and natural navigation.

The goal was to build something that the user would enjoy on every device. Therefore, reponsiveness has been a priority.
While many transitions and animations bring life into the page, the core is by choice very simple. 
There are only a few sections but still much room for content.

Another aspect is the builtin switch for color schemes, and therefore the option to integrate light and dark modes.
